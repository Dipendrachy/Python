print("Hello world!")







# Variables and data types
# Variables store data. Python has these basic types:

# Integers: age = 25
# Floats: price = 19.99
# Strings: name = "Alice"
# Booleans: is_student = True

#Example:
# name = "Alice"
# age = 30
# print("Name:", name)
# print("Age:", age)



#Use input to get data from user
# user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
# print("Hello,", user_name)




#Basic arithmetic operations
# a = 10
# b = 3
# print(a + b)  # 13 (addition)
# print(a // b) # 3 (integer division)
# print(a ** 2) # 100 (exponent)




#strings concatenation:
greeting = "Hello " + "World!"
print(greeting)  # "Hello World!"
